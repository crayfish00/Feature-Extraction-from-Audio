<!-- **Application of machine intelligence and deep learning in the subdomain of audio analysis is rapidly growing. Some examples include automatic speech recognition, digital signal processing, and audio classification, tagging and generation. Virtual assistants such as Alexa, Siri and Google Home are largely built atop models that can perform perform artificial cognition from audio data.** -->

<!-- **To train any statistical or ML model, we need to first extract useful features from an audio signal. Audio feature extraction is a necessary step in audio signal processing, which is a subfield of signal processing. It deals with the processing or manipulation of audio signals. It removes unwanted noise and balances the time-frequency ranges by converting digital and analog signals. It focuses on computational methods for altering the sounds.** -->
